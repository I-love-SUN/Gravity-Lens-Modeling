            Citizen science (also known as crowd science, crowd-sourced science,
            civic science, volunteer monitoring or networked science) is
            scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur
            (or nonprofessional) scientists. Citizen science is sometimes
            described as "public participation in scientific research,"
            participatory monitoring and participatory action research.

            CrowdSourcing lens-modeling is on analyzing mass distributions
            of gravitational lenses by adopting citizen science. This
            project is inspired by a citizen science project on lens-finding
            - SpaceWarps. Hopefully, we could utilize citizen science to
            improve the efficiency of the analysis of gravitational lenses,
            which can help us to solve the big data problem in the next
            generation large sky surveys.
